# image_picker_for_web

The web implementation of [`image_picker`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package is the endorsed implementation of `image_picker` for the web platform since version `0.6.7`, so it gets automatically added to your dependencies by depending on `image_picker: ^0.6.7`.

No modifications to your pubspec.yaml should be required in a recent enough version of Flutter (`>=1.12.13+hotfix.4`):

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  image_picker: ^0.6.7
  ...
...
```

### Use the plugin
You should be able to use `package:image_picker` as normal.
